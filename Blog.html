        <h1>QnA: Difference Global scope and block scope?</h1>
        <p>Answer: Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program. Variables declared with var , let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block. They all have Global Scope.Block scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block, from access by the outside of the block. The let & const keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped.</p>

        <h1>QnA: What is event loop in JavaScript?</h1>
        <p>Answer: Event Loop - The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript's asynchronous 
          programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a 
          few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.
          
          Easy Definition : 
          The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the 
          Callback Queue or Message Queue. 
          
          If the Call Stack is empty, it will take the first event from the
          Callback queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.

        <h1>QnA: How many Undefined?</h1>
        <p>Answer: Unassigned variables are initialized by JavaScript with a default value of undefined. Here as the variable is declared but not assigned to any value, the variable by default is assigned a value of undefined. <br>
          Undefined,<br> let b; <br> console.log(typeof b);<br>function a(){a=a+10}; console.log(a()); <br>window.undefined <br>

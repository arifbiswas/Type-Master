        <h1>QnA: Localstorage and Sessionstorage difference?</h1>
        <p>Answer: The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. </p>

        <h1>QnA: Difference Global scope and block scope?</h1>
        <p>Answer: Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program. Variables declared with var , let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block. They all have Global Scope.Block scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block, from access by the outside of the block. The let & const keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped. In order to access the variables of that specific block, we need to create an object for it.</p>

        <h1>QnA: What is event loop in JavaScript?</h1>
        <p>Answer: Event Loop - The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript's asynchronous 
          programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a 
          few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.
          
          Easy Definition : 
          The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the 
          Callback Queue or Message Queue. 
          
          If the Call Stack is empty, it will take the first event from the
          Callback queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. 
          
          Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop. 
          Each event is just a function callback.
          
          Easiest explanation : 
          When any Asynchronous event occur such as setTimeOut or promises... 
          Then these task takes some time to complete I/O if they have any. 
          If they completed their I/O or don't have any, then they simply put into 
          message queue or callback queue. Then event loop will firstly execute the 
          call stack tasks and then look for callback or message queue and then execute it.</p>
